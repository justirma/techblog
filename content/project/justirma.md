# My Personal Sites Journey!

So my personal site has been re-done many times. My first personal site started off as a site I made during a Girl Develop It class back in late 2015. It was my first time using a code editor, all my other playing around with code time had been on Codecademy or other online resources. Take a look down below of the journey of my personal sites :)

Each time the site got a more added it to it code wise. Played around with SASS, JS, jQuery, Foundation, Bootstrap, Material Design and many more.
