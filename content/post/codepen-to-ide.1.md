### Unclutter App Review 

Unclutter is a utility app for Mac that quickly provides a place for you to store notes,files and keeps history of what you copy to your clipboard. In all, keeping the clutter out of your Desktop. The app is currently only available for Macs, requires OS X 10.10 or later and will run $9.99 on unclutterapp.com or on the Mac App Store. You can also try the app out in trial mode for 10 days üòâ  

Of course, with any product I do recommend running the trial version first before diving into buying it. So I‚Äôll be leaving a link down below if you‚Äôd like to do the trial on your system. And stick around to the end of the video where I will share how to enter to win a code for full access to Unclutter! There will be 5 winners and really excited to have you all try out this app. 

So how does Unclutter work? And what do I think about it? Is it right for your workflow?Let‚Äôs find out. 

Once you download the trial or full version, you will notice the app show up at the very top of your display. 

Unclutter consists of three panes - files, notes and clipboard.  To bring the panes down, you can place your mouse pointer at the very top of your screen, like so. And simply scroll down using two fingers on your trackpad. The top of your screen reacts to scrolling so that is how this works. If your Mac is not setup with a trackpad or you have 2 displays setup, you can navigate over to the app icon and check "hold a modifier key‚Äù. With this on, you just have to move your mouse to the top of screen and press the key chosen, like CMD. 

Unclutter is available everywhere, even on full screen mode, different screens and spaces! So anywhere you are, Unclutter is there with you. You may be wondering if these panes are customizable? Yes, you can change the appearance, their size by dragging as well as their order. Or you can completely remove a pane if you notice you‚Äôre barely using it in your workflow. 

This pane contains a Clipboard on the left - this pane will store anything you copy to your clipboard. For example, lets say I‚Äôm browsing Medium.com and I come across this phrase that I‚Äôd like to look back on to keep my working hard. I can copy it to my clipboard and this pane will grab it. Making it really easy to look back on whenever I need too. I can also discard and clear my clipboard if its getting a little too large to handle. 

Middle pane is for files, this is neat if you‚Äôre wanting to unclutter your desktop. I usually use this if I‚Äôm doing a screencast for a review or doing a screen share with a coworker and would like to hide my personal files. I can just quickly drag my files and folders into this pane and thats it! A cool quirk, is that Unclutter gives you the ability to decide where you'd like to store and sync files and notes - in a folder, iCloud Drive, Dropbox. 

Lastly, is the Notes pane. Helps to unclutter the mind of any quick notes. In my workflow, I find Unclutter super helpful when I have to take really quick notes. Yes, I have Evernote but I only use Evernote for large note taking or blog drafts. What Unclutter allows me to do is jot down any ideas, thoughts or reminders I may have throughout the day. By clicking this ‚Äú+‚Äù you can add new notes if you need to split up the ‚Äútype‚Äù of notes taken. 

Now, clicking the Unclutter icon will give you a few quick menu options. 

* You can toggle ‚Äúshow window‚Äù to bring down the Unclutter pane
* The ‚Äúabout‚Äù will give you some version details 
* ‚ÄúQuick reference‚Äù will review that app tour you‚Äôll see upon downloading the app
* And a few others here - provide feedback, update check, buy unclutter and preferences

Unclutter is designed to be very simple and minimal. And for the most part its easy to get a hang of, but if you do run into any issues with the app or have a question the Unclutter support team is always ready to help! 

You will notice that once you start using Unclutter, it quickly becomes a part of your workflow. I find myself leaning on Unclutter every day for micro-interactions like taking quick notes, moving a file that i don‚Äôt want clogging up a folder and many other things. It‚Äôs a really convenient solution to some of the small tasks we do everyday and once you‚Äôve got it downloaded you won‚Äôt want to let it go. Highly recommended for you to try!
